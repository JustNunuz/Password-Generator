## Password Generator

  

This is a simple python program that generates a random password with user-defined complexity and length.

## Usage

To run this program, simply execute the python script in your preferred environment. The program will prompt you for the desired password length and complexity. The available complexity levels are:

  

 1. Human-readable
    
  2. Semi-readable
    
   3.  Completely Random

  

Based on the complexity level selected, the program will generate a password that may include uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and/or special characters.

If the user is not satisfied with the generated password, they can choose to increase the complexity by adding numbers, characters, and/or punctuation. The program will then generate a new password with the updated complexity.


Finally, the user can choose to copy the generated password to their clipboard.

## Requirements

  

This program requires Python 3.x to run. No additional packages or modules are required.

Sample Execution

  

    Howdy Name, Initiating Password Creation...
    
    Enter desired password length: 8
    
    Enter desired complexity (Human-readable, Semi-readable, Completely Random): Human-readable
    
    Your password is: 5o7nYw0J
    
    Are you satisfied with the password? (Y/N): n
    
    How can we increase complexity? (Add Numbers, Add Characters, Add Punctuation, All of the Above): All of the Above
    
    Your new password is: ☺☻♥♦♣♠
